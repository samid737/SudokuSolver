# SudokuSolver
Console based Sudoku Solver written in C# using backtracking algorithm. 

The implementation is largely based upon [Mitchell Johnson his implementation in C](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2012/06/18/solving-sudoku-in-c-with-recursive-backtracking/).

For comparison, the solver.rar files contains two builds. One is purely based on the above implementation, one is adapted to class based design. The latter seems to have some performance increase for puzzle2.txt.

This was part of an exercise. Feedback, suggestions, improvements etc. are much appreciated. If you have any remarks, questions, anything, feel free to contact me.
